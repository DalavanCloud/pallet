 @class MPMutableDictionary
 @abstract A subclass of NSMutableDictionary that is the base of most MacPort API objects
 @discussion The dictionary data structure is appropriate for representing various aspects
 of the MacPorts system such as port objects, receipt objects etc. Clients of this framework
 can treat subclasses of MPMutableDictionary objects as NSMutableDictionaries which can
 be useful for some GUI programming tasks like displaying information in a table. In order
 to properly subclass an NSMutableDictionary, this class also contains an internal NSMutableDictionary
 object. See http://www.smackie.org/Notes/2007/07/11/subclassing-nsmutabledictionary/ for some more
 information on subclassing NSMutableDictionary.

/*Due to issues we are having with unit testing the main MPInterpreter
 *class, I am creating this alternate class that doesn't take different
 *threads into account. I will suggest that the coding for multithreading
 *be done at a level above the framework rather than within the framework.
 *If this class does give the same issues, that is.
